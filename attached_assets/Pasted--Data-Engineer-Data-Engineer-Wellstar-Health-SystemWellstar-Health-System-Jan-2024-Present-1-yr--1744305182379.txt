Built and deployed a real-time machine learning-powered recommendation engine, integrating customer browsing history, past purchases, and engagement data to personalize retail product suggestions. The model increased click-through rates on recommended products by 22% and led to a 5% increase in upsell revenue.
Developed an end-to-end experimentation framework, applying Bayesian optimization techniques to dynamically adjust recommendation strategies based on real-time user interactions. This approach resulted in a 12% improvement in recommendation accuracy, ensuring higher user engagement with suggested products.
Designed a scalable ETL pipeline in Spark and Redshift, aggregating multi-source data streams (web interactions, app engagements, transaction records) to ensure seamless integration for recommendation modeling. The automation reduced data processing time by 35%, enabling real-time personalization updates.
Created visualization dashboards in Tableau and Power BI, allowing product and marketing teams to track the effectiveness of recommendation strategies. This data-driven approach empowered teams to refine promotional campaigns and personalized offers, enhancing the customer shopping experience.
Conducted experimentation and A/B testing to assess the impact of personalized commerce experiences, driving continuous improvement in customer interaction models.Built and deployed a real-time machine learning-powered recommendation engine, integrating customer browsing history, past purchases, and engagement data to personalize retail product suggestions.
